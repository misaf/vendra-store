 * Resolves the billing owner behind a store's `reseller_id`.
 *
 * A store may be created directly by the platform console (no owner) or by a
 * reseller that owns several. The reseller domain is a layer *above* the store,
 * so the store package holds only the owner's key and asks through this port
 * when it needs the owner itself — that is what keeps `misaf/vendra-store`
 * installable, and testable, without `misaf/vendra-reseller`.
 *
 * `misaf/vendra-reseller` binds the Eloquent implementation; without it the
 * {@see \Misaf\VendraStore\Support\NullStoreOwnerResolver} resolves nothing.
