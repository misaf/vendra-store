 * Removes the workload behind a storefront, then the row that described it.

 * Order matters and is deliberate: the container goes first, because a database
 * row deleted while its container keeps serving is an orphan nothing will ever
 * find again. The reverse — a removed container and a surviving row — is
 * recoverable by redeploying.
 *
 * There is no transaction around this. A runtime cannot participate in one, and
 * pretending otherwise would only mean a rolled-back delete leaving a container
 * that is already gone.
