/**
 * Brings one storefront's runtime into line with what the platform intends.
 *
 * Observe, diff, then apply the *smallest* verb that closes the gap. That last
 * part is the whole point: this used to be a forced redeploy of everything, and
 * since provisioning replaces a container rather than updating it, asking to
 * reconcile an estate took every storefront in it down and back up. A stopped
 * storefront needs starting, not rebuilding.
 *
 * Reconciliation reads intent and never writes it. `desired_state` is a decision
 * somebody made — an operator stopping a storefront, a deployment requesting
 * one — and a converge pass that edited it would be deciding rather than
 * converging, which is how a deliberately stopped storefront gets started again
 * every pass.
