/**
 * Move a store to a different billing owner, or to none.
 *
 * The console owns this operation: a store may be created for one reseller and
 * later handed to another, or taken back and run by the platform directly. A
 * null owner is that second case, not an error.
 *
 * Reassignment is a creation as far as the receiving owner's plan is concerned
 * — it consumes a slot they have to have — so it goes through the same
 * {@see StoreQuota} check and the same row lock as a fresh store. Without the
 * lock, two operators handing two stores to the same reseller could both see
 * its last free slot.
 *
 * This action names no reseller: the store package sits below the reseller
 * domain, so an owner arrives typed as a `SubscriptionSubscriber` and only
 * `stores.reseller_id` — a plain nullable key here — records which one it was.
