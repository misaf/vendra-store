/**
 * Deletes a store, taking its storefront down first.
 *
 * The lifecycle is explicit rather than left to Eloquent's cascade: the cascade
 * would remove the deployment row and leave the container running with nothing
 * left that knows its name — an orphan serving a domain the platform no longer
 * believes it owns.
 *
 * The two halves cannot be one transaction. A container removal is not
 * rollback-able, so it happens first and outside; only once the runtime is
 * settled do the business records go, inside a transaction of their own. A
 * failure in between leaves a store whose storefront is gone, which the
 * operator can retry — the reverse would leak infrastructure silently.
