/**
 * Deletes a store, with its storefront settled by the same delete.
 *
 * The storefront half is not here. It used to be, and that was the bug: a store
 * deleted through any other path — the console table, the reseller table,
 * `OffboardResellerAction` — left its container running and serving the
 * customer's domain. The cascade now lives in {@see StoreObserver}, which every
 * delete passes through whether it came from an action or not, so a soft delete
 * stops the storefront and a force delete destroys it no matter who asked.
 *
 * What survives here is the transaction: deleting a store writes to `stores`,
 * `store_domains`, and `storefront_deployments`, and a half-applied delete is a
 * store with no domains still answering as though it had them.
