     * Replace a store's active domain, retaining the previous one as history.
     *
     * The current active domain (active = true) is demoted to a replaced
     * history record (active = false) and soft-deleted, so it stops resolving
     * but stays visible behind the trashed filter. A fresh active domain is
     * then created. Runs in the store's own tenant context so the domain
     * records are scoped to this store regardless of the currently active one.
     *
     * Demotion and creation share one transaction. Without it a failing
     * create — a unique collision on the new domain is the likely one — leaves
     * the previous domain already deactivated and trashed, so the store
     * resolves to nothing and is unreachable with no automatic way back.
     *
     * The storefront moves with it. A storefront is routed by a `Host()` rule in
     * a container label, and a container's labels cannot be edited in place, so
     * following the store to its new domain means replacing the container —
     * which is what provisioning does anyway. Leaving that out was the bug: the
     * storefront went on answering the old domain, the new one had no router at
     * all, and convergence could not see the difference.
