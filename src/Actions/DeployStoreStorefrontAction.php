/**
 * Deploys or redeploys one store's storefront, and records what happened.
 *
 * Deploy and redeploy are the same operation: the provisioner replaces whatever
 * is there, so a first deployment, a configuration change, and a moved image tag
 * all take this path. That is what makes retrying safe.
 *
 * Nothing here is transactional with the database on purpose. A container cannot
 * join a SQL transaction, so the row is moved to Processing first, the runtime
 * work happens outside, and the outcome is written afterwards — a crash in
 * between leaves a row that says "in progress", which reconciliation can fix,
 * rather than a committed lie in either direction.
