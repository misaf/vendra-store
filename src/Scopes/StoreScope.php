 * packages are owned through the neutral `tenant_id` column and scoped by that
 * one. A handful of tables — a store's domains, its storefront deployment —
 * describe the Store itself rather than data inside it, so they carry an
 * explicit `store_id` and are scoped here. Both read the same current tenant,
 * because in Vendra the current tenant *is* the store.
