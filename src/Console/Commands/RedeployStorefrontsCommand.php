 * Rebuilds every storefront the platform intends to be running.

 * Destructive by design, which is why it is its own command rather than a flag
 * on `storefront:reconcile`. Provisioning replaces a container instead of
 * updating it, so each storefront here is removed and recreated and is down for
 * its own pull, start, and health gate — sequentially, since one worker serves
 * the storefront queue. On an estate of any size that is an outage, and it
 * should be asked for by name.
 *
 * Reach for it when the change is one convergence cannot see: a storefront image
 * republished under the same reference, or an edge label that only a fresh
 * container will carry. Ordinary drift is `storefront:reconcile`.
