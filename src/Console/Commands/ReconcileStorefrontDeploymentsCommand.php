 * Makes the estate match what the database says it should be.
 *
 * Every deployment is examined, including the ones intended to be stopped: a
 * storefront still running against a Stopped intent is drift in the same way a
 * missing one is, and only a pass that looks at both can fix either.
 *
 * This is cheap and safe to repeat. It corrects with the narrowest verb that
 * works — start a stopped container, stop a running one, redeploy only what is
 * absent, unhealthy, or serving the wrong image — so a converged estate comes
 * through a pass untouched. Use `storefront:redeploy` to rebuild deliberately.
