/**
 * Removes one storefront's container, off the request lifecycle.
 *
 * Queued for the same reason deployment is: only the storefront worker holds a
 * runtime socket, and an operator closing a store should not wait on a container
 * to stop. It runs on the same queue for that reason.
 *
 * Addressed by slug, not by deployment id, and that is the point of it. This job
 * is dispatched while a store is being force-deleted, so the deployment row it
 * would otherwise look up is removed by the cascade before the worker ever picks
 * the job up. Carrying the slug — the platform's stable handle, and what the
 * container name derives from — is what lets it outlive the record.
 *
 * There is nothing to record afterwards: the row is already gone, so this
 * reaches the provisioner port directly rather than through an action that would
 * have no state left to write.
