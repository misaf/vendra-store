/**
 * Keeps a store's domains and its storefront in step with the store itself.
 *
 * Every hook runs inside `$store->execute()` so the domain query resolves
 * against this store rather than whatever tenant happens to be active on the
 * request. Synchronous because `deleting` has to see the domains while they are
 * still there, and because `isForceDeleting()` is request state that would not
 * survive a trip through the queue.
 *
 * The storefront cascade lives here rather than in the delete path a panel
 * happens to call, because there is no single such path: the console table, the
 * reseller table, and `OffboardResellerAction` all delete stores directly. A
 * store deleted with its container left running is an orphan still serving the
 * customer's domain, and once a force delete has taken the deployment row with
 * it, nothing is left that knows the container's name. This hook is the one
 * place every delete has to pass through.
 *
 * The runtime work is queued, never done here: only the storefront worker holds
 * a container socket, and the panels run in a container that does not. It is
 * also dispatched `afterCommit` — `OffboardResellerAction` deletes stores inside
 * a transaction, and a rolled-back offboarding must not leave a fleet stopped.
