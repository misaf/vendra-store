/**
 * Runs each storefront as one container, through whichever runtime is bound.
 *
 * This class is the whole of the store layer's knowledge about containers,
 * and even that is second-hand: it composes a {@see ContainerDefinition} and
 * hands it to {@see ContainerRuntime}. It has no idea whether Docker or Podman
 * answered, because the difference is a binding in `vendra-container` and not a
 * branch anywhere.
 *
 * The platform owns the storefront containers and nothing around them. The
 * network, the reverse proxy, and the TLS material belong to whoever runs the
 * estate, so this reads that environment and refuses to guess at it: an absent
 * network is an error naming the network, not an improvised bridge the proxy is
 * not attached to.
