/**
 * Runs each storefront as one container, through whichever runtime is bound.
 *
 * This class is the whole of the store layer's knowledge about containers,
 * It composes a storefront-specific definition and hands it to the runtime
 * adapter backed by `misaf/laravel-docker-engine`. Docker and Podman selection
 * stays in that package's Laravel Manager configuration.
 *
 * The platform owns the storefront containers and nothing around them. The
 * network, the reverse proxy, and the TLS material belong to whoever runs the
 * estate, so this reads that environment and refuses to guess at it: an absent
 * network is an error naming the network, not an improvised bridge the proxy is
 * not attached to.
