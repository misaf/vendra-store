# Vendra Store

## Workflow

- Inspect `composer.json`, sibling files, and existing tests before changing the package.
- Use Laravel Boost `application-info` and `search-docs` before code changes.
- Apply `laravel-best-practices` to Laravel PHP and `pest-testing` whenever tests change.
- Keep changes inside this package's boundary and preserve its public contracts.
- Add or update focused Pest coverage, then run `php artisan test --compact --testsuite=vendra-store` from the project root.

## Translatable Persistence

- Making a persisted model field translatable is an explicit domain choice unless this package already requires it.
- Every field listed in a model's `$translatable` array must definitely use a JSON database column. Keep its model traits/casts, factories, validation, Filament locale UI, API serialization, and tests translation-aware.
- A field not listed in `$translatable` must use the appropriate scalar database type and must not use Spatie Translatable, translatable slug traits, locale switchers, translated callbacks, or translation-shaped array data.

## Vendra Transitive API Policy

- Treat a Vendra dependency intentionally exposed through the public API of a directly required Vendra platform package as part of the supported public contract of that package.
- Do not add a redundant direct Composer requirement solely because source code imports a type from that exposed dependency.
- Apply this only to Vendra platform packages listed under `require`; never extend it to `require-dev`, `suggest`, incidental implementation dependencies, or third-party packages. Removing or replacing an exposed dependency is a breaking change; keep `self.version` alignment across the Vendra package graph.

## Module Boundary

- This package owns the **ecommerce Store**: the concrete tenant model, its domains, and its storefront lifecycle. It owns *what* a storefront should be and *when* it should change; it never owns *how* a runtime is driven — that lives behind `Contracts\StorefrontProvisioner`.

## Store As Tenant

- `Models\Store` implements `Misaf\VendraTenant\Contracts\TenantContract` and extends Spatie's tenant, so **Store IS the tenant**: there is no `tenants` table, no `Store -> Tenant` relation, and no 1:1 pair. It is wired in `config/vendra-tenant.php` (`model`, `relation`) and `config/multitenancy.php` (`tenant_model`, `tenant_finder`).
- `Store::accessible()` — active, provisioning-ready, not billing-suspended — is the request-serving boundary. Both `Services\StoreDomainFinder` and the engine's resolver search options go through it; never expose or resolve an inaccessible store.
- `Services\StoreDomainFinder` is the adapter behind the engine's `Misaf\VendraTenant\Contracts\HostTenantFinder` port. Host-to-store mapping lives here, never in `misaf/vendra-tenant`.
- Replace active domains through `Actions\ReplaceStoreDomainAction`: normalize and validate the replacement, retain the old domain as soft-deleted history, create the new active domain inside the store's own tenant context, and carry the storefront over — update the deployment's `domain` in the same transaction, then dispatch a forced `ProvisionStorefrontJob`. Routing lives in a container label that cannot be edited, so a domain change is a container replacement.
- Operator availability and failed provisioning recovery use `SuspendStoreAction`, `ReactivateStoreAction`, and `RetryStoreProvisioningAction`. Redeploy/retry use their domain actions and the existing deployment job/transition rules.
- Business removal uses `OffboardStoreAction`, which requires an audit reason and soft-deletes after inactivation; restoration uses `RestoreOffboardedStoreAction`, rechecks owner quota, and respects provisioning readiness. Do not expose force deletion as an operator workflow.
- Deleting a store settles its storefront in `Observers\StoreObserver`, not in the caller: soft delete records `StorefrontDesiredState::Stopped` and queues `ReconcileStorefrontJob`; force delete queues `DestroyStorefrontJob`, addressed by slug because the deployment row is cascaded away first. `Actions\DeleteStoreAction` is the transactional entry point for a programmatic delete and no longer touches the runtime itself.
- Two ownership columns, two mechanisms. Reusable domain packages own their rows through the **neutral `tenant_id`** and `Misaf\VendraSupport\Tenancy\BelongsToTenant`. Records describing the Store itself — `store_domains`, `storefront_deployments` — carry **`store_id`** and use `Concerns\BelongsToStore` / `Scopes\StoreScope`. Never add `store_id` to a reusable package's table, and never register a `store_id` table in the support `TenantTableRegistry`.
- Ownership is optional and inverted: `stores.reseller_id` is a plain nullable indexed column, the owner is fetched through `Contracts\StoreOwnerResolver`, and `ProvisionStoreAction` / `CreateStorePage::resolveOwner()` take `(Model&SubscriptionSubscriber)|null`. A null owner is a store the console owns directly, not an error.
- It depends on `misaf/vendra-container` for the runtime and on `misaf/vendra-tenant` for the tenancy engine it plugs its `Store` into. It must **not** depend on `misaf/vendra-reseller`: a store's billing owner is reached through `Contracts\StoreOwnerResolver`, which the reseller package binds. Keep the arrow pointing reseller → store.
- Panels belong to their own packages. Put shared schemas, page bases, actions, and concerns here; put the panel-specific resource in `vendra-console` or `vendra-reseller`.

## Provisioner Contract

- `provision`, `start`, `stop`, `restart`, `destroy`, `observe`, `logs` — typed value objects on both sides, never arrays.
- Idempotence is part of the contract: provisioning twice leaves one storefront; starting a running one, stopping a stopped one, and destroying an absent one all succeed.
- `observe()` returns a `StorefrontObservation` rich enough to tell "stopped" from "running the wrong image", and must never answer "absent" for an unreachable runtime.
- `ContainerStorefrontProvisioner` builds its container through `Support\StorefrontContainerDefinitionFactory` after `Support\StorefrontConfigurationValidator` accepts the configuration. Anything Docker-shaped stops inside `misaf/vendra-container`.

## Deployment Lifecycle

- `RequestStorefrontDeploymentAction` → `ProvisionStorefrontJob` → `StorefrontDeployment`. Reconciliation and retry go through `StorefrontDeploymentDispatchCommand`; do not add a second dispatch path.
- `CreateStorePage` skips the request only for explicit `create_storefront=false`. The console wizard may expose this through `StorefrontConfigurationFields::creationToggle()` and must use optional storefront field rules; the reseller form remains mandatory.
- `StorefrontImage` records the operator-approved immutable image reference and its built-in themes. New deployments may select only active catalog entries; existing deployments keep using their selected entry after it is disabled. Never reintroduce global `STOREFRONT_IMAGE` or `STOREFRONT_THEMES` configuration.
- Write status only via `markProcessing()`, `markReady()`, `markRequested()`, `markFailed()`. `Enums\StorefrontDeploymentStatus::transitions()` is the transition table and `InvalidStorefrontTransitionException` is the rejection.
- A failing attempt with retries left stays `Processing`; only `ProvisionStorefrontJob::failed()` writes `Failed`.
- `ProvisionStorefrontJob` runs on its own `storefronts` queue, served by the single worker that holds a runtime socket. Do not move it onto a shared queue.

## Configuration

- Read infrastructure values in `config/vendra-store.php` only through the injected `Support\StorefrontSettings`. Keep it bound with `bind()` so config changes are picked up on the next resolve.
- Whether the platform is creating stores at all is `Settings\StoreCreationSettings` (group `store_creation`, `global` repository), read through `Support\StoreCreationPolicy`. Console and reseller store creation both consume the policy, so the shared rule lives below both panels.
- Runtime differences (Docker vs. a Podman compatibility socket, log driver, health-check behaviour) are configuration, never a branch. Do not add runtime sniffing.

## Testing

- Use `Misaf\VendraContainer\Testing\FakeContainerRuntime` rather than a real daemon; domain tests must not require Docker or Podman.
- Cover each lifecycle transition, including the illegal ones the enum rejects, and the retry path that must not mark a deployment `Failed` early.
- Cover the tenancy side too: Store acting as the current tenant, host resolution, `store_id` scoping of store domains, and the ownership port defaulting to `Support\NullStoreOwnerResolver`.
- Keep the architecture rules in `tests/ArchTest.php` asserting this package does not use `Misaf\VendraReseller` or `Misaf\VendraConsole`, and that actions, jobs and models stay behind the provisioning port.

## Filament

- Resources with a cluster live in `src/Filament/Clusters/Resources/`; resources without one live in `src/Filament/Resources/`. This package currently ships pages, schemas, actions, and concerns rather than resources.
